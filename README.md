# Crop-Price-Prediction

This project provides a solution for forecasting the prices of agricultural commodities using a Flask-based web application. It uses historical crop data, rainfall statistics, and decision tree regression models to predict crop prices. The application also visualizes the forecasted data on an interactive web dashboard.
